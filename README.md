# CFG2015

For the JP Morgan Code for Good 2015 hackathon - made for Age UK.

A system to automate the previously paper and manual input survey based system to recruit volunteers and the elderly to Age UK's telephone befriending service.

Uses a Java JSP front end, connecting to a Cassandra database cluster.

Features a matching algorithm to rate how the interests of the volunteer match those of the elderly person in order to have the most in common.

Also used Twilio's API to automatically call the elderly person, to ensure that the personal data of both parties is kept secure.
